i need an node.js image gallery app that looks like the demo i provided.  with following features:

- you get a folder as an ENV variable that contains images and subfolders with images
- the files might be large in size so you need to create thumbnails and indexes on the fly and cache them locally
- the app should display the images in a grid view with infinite scrolling
- clicking on an image should open a lightbox view with next/previous navigation
- the app should support basic image metadata display (like filename, size, dimensions)
- the app should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices
- the app should have a search functionality to filter images by filename
- the app should be able to handle a large number of images efficiently
